Simple hack for changing avatar to another sprite as you move between rooms.

HOW TO USE:
Edit hackOptions to set up the avatar list for rooms you move through.

By default, the avatar will reset to the default if you enter a room without a sprite defined.
This can also be changed in the hackOptions below to instead apply avatar changes permanently.
