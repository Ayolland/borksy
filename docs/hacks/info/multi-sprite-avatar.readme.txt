Allows multiple sprites to be moved together along with the player
to create the illusion of a larger avatar.

Notes:
- will probably break any other hacks involving moving other sprites 
  around (they'll probably use the player's modified collision)
- the original avatar sprite isn't changed, but will be covered by 
  a piece at x:0,y:0
- this hack may have issues with exit-from-dialog

HOW TO USE:
Edit `pieces` in hack options below to customize the multi-sprite avatar.
