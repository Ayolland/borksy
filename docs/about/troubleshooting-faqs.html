<p><strong>After I add hacks using Borksy, when I load my html file back into Bitsy, all my hacks are gone.</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Bitsy can&#8217;t read hacks added through Borksy. So you need to edit your game in the Bitsy editor, and then modify it with Borksy. It is wise to keep a copy of your Bitsy game saved without any Borky modifications.</p>

<p><strong>My Borksy game won&#8217;t download?</strong></p>

<p>Some game files can be too big for Borksy on certain browsers. If your game reaches a certain size, you may have to add hacks manually using a text-editor instead of using Borksy.</p>

<p><strong>What happened to the 3d hack? Can I use Borksy with Bitsy 3d?</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, not at this moment. Hopefully Bitsy 3d support will be back in the future!</p>

<p><strong>After using Borksy, the dialogue in my game isn&#8217;t showing up, and instead there&#8217;s just an empty dialogue box.</strong></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using a custom font, make sure that the font data is included when you paste your game data into Borksy. In Bitsy, the font data is hidden by default, even if you&#8217;re using a custom font. In order for it be able to be copied, you&#8217;ll need to click the &#8216;font data&#8217; button on the button of the &#8216;game data&#8217; window in Bitsy before copy your game data.</p>

<p><strong>My Bitsy HD game is not working after I use Borksy.</strong></p>

<p>Make sure you&#8217;ve selected a &#8216;Borksy HD&#8217; option from the &#8216;Bitsy Version&#8217; menu before you save out your Bitsy HD game.</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;m using X hack and it&#8217;s not working.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t guarantee every hack will work with every Bitsy version, or even at all. It could be a bug or issue with the hack, or with Borksy, or even with Bitsy. Make sure and test the hacks you want to use for your game before you get too far into development.</p>

<p><strong>I don&#8217;t see the hack I need in Borksy.</strong></p>

<p>You can still add other hacks into your game using Borksy. You&#8217;ll need to paste the hack into the &#8216;Additional JS&#8217; field. This isn&#8217;t too tricky, but you&#8217;ll have to make sure you&#8217;re pasting everything you need in.</p>

<p><strong>I need further help getting my game to work.</strong></p>
