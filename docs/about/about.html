<p>Sep 16, 2021 - What&#8217;s new in 4.6.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>Added Bitsy 7.10 template</li>
</ul>

<p>The Bitsy 7.8 templates and older are kept in Borksy as a legacy feature, however currently most hacks have been updated to support Bitsy 7.10 and may not be compatible with older versions. If you are building a project using an older version of Bitsy, Borksy may not be a good solution for you. Seek help in the Bitsy discord if you are working on a Bitsy project that requires older versions of Bitsy.</p>
