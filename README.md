Borksy is a tool made to assist in hacking and extending games built with Bitsy Game Maker.

[**View the Demo**](http://ayolland.github.io/borksy/)

Borksy uses jquery (don't even start) to assemble and compile text files and user input into a final HTML file that runs the Bitsy game.

Current features:
* Preloaded Hacks Menu
* HotKeys
* Customize HTML/CSS
* Font Importer and Presets
* Enables extended ASCII characters
* Field for extra JS / Hacks
* Saves work to LocalStorage for persistence

Planned features:
* HTML/CSS Theme Presets
* More Hacks

Borksy relies heavily on [the work done here by Sean](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks) creating and collecting hacks for Bitsy.
