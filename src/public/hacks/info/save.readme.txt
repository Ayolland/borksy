Introduces save/load functionality.

Includes:
  - data that may be saved/loaded:
    - current room/position within room
    - inventory/items in rooms
    - dialog variables
    - dialog position
  - basic autosave
  - dialog tags:
    - (save): saves game
    - (load ""): loads game; parameter is text to show as title on load
    - (clear): clears saved game
    - (saveNow)/(loadNow)/(clearNow): instant varieties of above tags

Notes:
  - Storage is implemented through browser localStorage: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
    Remember to clear storage while working on a game, otherwise loading may prevent you from seeing your changes!
    You can use the `clearOnStart` option to do this for you when testing.
  - This hack only tracks state which could be modified via vanilla bitsy features,
    i.e. compatability with other hacks that modify state varies;
    you may need to modify save/load to include/exclude things for compatability.
    (feel free to ask for help tailoring these to your needs!)
  - There is only one "save slot"; it would not be too difficult to implement more,
    but it adds a lot of complexity that most folks probably don't need.

HOW TO USE:
