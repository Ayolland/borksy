This can be used to simplify complex dialog
by moving portions to self-contained dialog entries,
and then jumping to the appropriate id when necessary.

You can also provide raw dialog text instead of an id;
Functionally this isn't much different from writing raw dialog text,
but it has some uses for advanced cases (e.g. when combined with dialog choices)

Usage:
  (jump "dialogId")
  (jumpNow "dialogId")
  (jump "dialog to print")
  (jumpNow "dialog to print")
  
Note: be careful of infinite loops, e.g.
DLG_infinite_loop
"""
this will print forever(jump "DLG_infinite_loop")
"""
