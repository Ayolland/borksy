Adds a (p) tag to the dialogue parser that forces the following text to 
start on a fresh dialogue screen, eliminating the need to spend hours testing
line lengths or adding multiple line breaks that then have to be reviewed
when you make edits or change the font size.

Usage: (p)
       
Example: I am a cat(p)and my dialogue contains multitudes

NOTE: This uses parentheses "()" instead of curly braces "{}" around function
      calls because the Bitsy editor's fancy dialog window strips unrecognized
      curly-brace functions from dialog text. To keep from losing data, write
      these function calls with parentheses like the examples above.
      For full editor integration, you'd *probably* also need to paste this
      code at the end of the editor's `bitsy.js` file. Untested.
