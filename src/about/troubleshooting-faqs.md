- > After I add hacks using Borksy, when I load my html file back into Bitsy, all my hacks are gone.

  Yes. Bitsy can't read hacks added through Borksy. So you need to edit your game in the Bitsy editor, and then modify it with Borksy. It is wise to keep a copy of your Bitsy game saved without any Borky modifications.

- > My Borksy game won't download?

  Some game files can be too big for Borksy on certain browsers. If your game reaches a certain size, you may have to add hacks manually using a text-editor instead of using Borksy.

- > What happened to X hack which used to be included in Borksy?

  Borksy simply pulls data from [the hacks repo](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks). If a hack you used is missing, try checking why it was removed there, or report an issue if you believe it's missing due to a bug.

- > After using Borksy, the dialogue in my game isn't showing up, and instead there's just an empty dialogue box.

  If you're using a custom font, make sure that the font data is included when you paste your game data into Borksy. In Bitsy, the font data is hidden by default, even if you're using a custom font. In order for it be able to be copied, you'll need to click the 'font data' button on the button of the 'game data' window in Bitsy before copy your game data.

- > My Bitsy HD game is not working after I use Borksy.

  Make sure you've selected a 'Borksy HD' option from the 'Bitsy Version' menu before you save out your Bitsy HD game.

- > I'm using X hack and it's not working.

  Unfortunately, most hacks will only work with the latest Bitsy version. It's possible for there to be bugs or issues with the hack, or with Borksy, or even with Bitsy itself. Make sure and test the hacks and version of Bitsy you want to use for your game before you get too far into development.

- > I don't see the hack I need in Borksy.

  You can add custom hacks or hacks from sources other than the hacks repo into your game using Borksy. You'll need to paste the hack into the 'Additional JS' field. This isn't too tricky, but you'll have to make sure you're pasting everything you need in.

- > I need further help getting my game to work.

  The [Bitsy discord](discordapp.com/invite/9rAjhtr) is a great place to get help with Bitsy or Borksy.

- > Can I use Borksy for \<X commercial project\>?

  Borksy is free to use, and you maintain ownership of projects you use it for.
  
  However, the creators of Borksy are against web3. If you're using Borksy for the purpose of minting NFTs we want you to know you're both a bad person and a loser.
