Borksy is a hacking tool to be used in conjunction with [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)! Use it to customize your games and add hacks without needing a web server or any manual cut-and-paste work.

If you're not sure how to use this tool, check out the 'How To Use Borksy' section. If you're having issues, check the 'Troubleshooting/FAQs' section. If you're not familiar with how Bitsy can be extended, explore [Sean's great collection of Bitsy hacks](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/).

The Bitsy 7.8 templates and older are kept in Borksy as a legacy feature, however currently most hacks have been updated to support Bitsy 7.10 and may not be compatible with older versions. If you are building a project using an older version of Bitsy, Borksy may not be a good solution for you. Seek help in the Bitsy discord if you are working on a Bitsy project that requires older versions of Bitsy.
