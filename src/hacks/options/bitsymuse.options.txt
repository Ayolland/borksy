// You need to put an entry in this list for every room ID 
// or name that is accessible by the player, and then specify 
// the song ID for each room. Expand this list to as many 
// rooms as you need.

// If the player moves between rooms with the same audio ID 
// the music keeps playing seamlessly. Undefined rooms will 
// keep playing whatever music they were last playing.

// You can set a room to stop music when you enter by using 
// the silenceId instead of a song ID. By default, this is 
// set to 'S'.

// These values are examples, and this hack WILL NOT WORK 
// with these values. Check the Readme for setup instructions.
