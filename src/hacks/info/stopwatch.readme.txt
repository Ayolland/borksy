Usage:
  (startWatch "timer id"): starts a timer with provided id
  (stopWatch "timer id"): stops a timer with provided id
  (resumeWatch "timer id"): resumes a timer with provided id
  (sayWatch "timer id"): prints a timer with provided id

There's also startWatchNow, stopWatchNow, and resumeWatchNow,
which do the same things, but immediately instead of when dialog ends.

Notes on edge/error cases:
  (startWatch "existing id"): overwrites existing timer
  (stopWatch "non-existent id"): does nothing
  (stopWatch "stopped id"): does nothing
  (resumeWatch "non-existent id"): starts new timer
  (resumeWatch "running id"): does nothing
  (sayWatch "non-existent id"): throws error

HOW TO USE:
1. Include hack using Borsky
2. Customize `timeToString` function in hackOptions below as needed
3. Add tags to your dialog as needed

NOTE: This uses parentheses "()" instead of curly braces "{}" around function
      calls because the Bitsy editor's fancy dialog window strips unrecognized
      curly-brace functions from dialog text. To keep from losing data, write
      these function calls with parentheses like the examples above.
      For full editor integration, you'd *probably* also need to paste this
      code at the end of the editor's `bitsy.js` file. Untested.
