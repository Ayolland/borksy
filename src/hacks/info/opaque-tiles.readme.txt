Render the player underneath certain tiles
instead of always on top of the map.

Note: compatible with transparency hack!

HOW TO USE:
1. Include hack
2. Update the `tileIsOpaque` function below to match your needs

By default, add the word 'OPAQUE' to the name 
of every tile you need to be opaque in the Bitsy editor.
