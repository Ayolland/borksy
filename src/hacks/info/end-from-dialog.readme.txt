Lets you end the game from dialog (including inside conditionals).

Using the (end) function in any part of a series of dialog will make the
game end after the dialog is finished. Ending the game resets it back to the
intro.

Using (endNow) at the end of a sentence will display the whole sentence and
immediately clear the background. No further dialog from that passage will
display, and the game will reset when you proceed. Using (endNow) with
narration text will immediately exit the dialog, clear the background, and
show the ending narration in an ending-style centered dialog box.

Usage: (end)
       (end "<ending narration>")
       (endNow)
       (endNow "<ending narration>")

Example: (end)
         (end "Five friars bid you goodbye. You leave the temple, hopeful.")
         (endNow "The computer is still online! The chamber floods with neurotoxin.")

NOTE: This uses parentheses "()" instead of curly braces "{}" around function
      calls because the Bitsy editor's fancy dialog window strips unrecognized
      curly-brace functions from dialog text. To keep from losing data, write
      these function calls with parentheses like the examples above.
