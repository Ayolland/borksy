An expanded version of the character portraits hack
that includes support for animated GIFs.

Examples:
	(portrait "cat")
		draws the image named "cat" in the hackOptions
	(portrait "")
		resets the portrait to not draw

By default, the portrait will clear when dialog is exited,
but this can be customized in the hackOptions below.

All portraits are drawn from the top-left corner, on top of the game and below the dialog box.
They are scaled uniformly according to the hackOptions below,
and are cropped to bitsy's canvas width/height.

Notes:
	- GIFs have to be fetched asynchronously, which means they won't work by default
	  when running from a local file in chrome. They will work in firefox or when run from a server.
	- Individual frame delays are respected
	  (you can use frame delays instead of duplicated frames to optimize pauses)
	- Non-looping GIFs are supported
	- Non-GIFs which work with the base hack are supported
	- This hack is larger, more complicated, and less performant
	  than the base portrait hack, so if you're not using animations
	  make sure to use the base one instead
