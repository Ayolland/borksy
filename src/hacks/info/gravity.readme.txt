Overrides Bitsy movement logic to simulate "gravity".

Features
-----------------
- Treats walls and sprites as "solid" objects that can be stood on
- Does not allow player to move upwards unless they are on a climbable tile or
jump/jetpack/force are activated
- Does not allow player to move horizontally unless they are standing on a
wall or sprite or climbable/standable tile
- Forces player to "fall" any time they are not on a wall or sprite
- Restricts how much the player can move horizontally while falling
- Calculates fall damage any time the player lands on a wall or sprite
- All invalid movement inputs (i.e, moving into a wall, pressing up while falling)
are converted into down presses

Dialog Tags
-----------------
- (toggleGravity) Toggle gravity on/off
- (setJumpPower NUM) Sets how many tiles the player can move/jump straight up.
Replace NUM with a whole number (setJumpPower 1). JumpPower is refreshed every time
the player lands on the ground.
- (toggleJetpack) Allows player to "jetpack"/jump upwards while already in the air.
Moving upwards still consumes JumpPower, which is only refreshed upon landing.
- (setGravityDirection "DIRECTION") Makes gravity flow in DIRECTION.
Replace DIRECTION with "up", "down", "left", or "right".
- (forceGravity "DIRECTION") Forces the player to move in the given DIRECTION until
they hit something. Replace DIRECTION with "up", "down", "left", or "right".
