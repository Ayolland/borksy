Adds a tag (portrait "id") which adds the ability to draw high resolution images during dialog.

Examples:
  (portrait "cat")
    draws the image named "cat" in the hackOptions
  (portrait "")
    resets the portrait to not draw

All portraits are drawn from the top-left corner, on top of the game and below the dialog box.

They are scaled uniformly according to the hackOptions below,
and are cropped to bitsy's canvas width/height.

All portraits are preloaded, but their loading state is ignored.
i.e. The game will start before they have all loaded,
and they simply won't draw if they're not loaded or have errored out.

All standard browser image formats are supported, but keep filesize in mind!
Note: The hack is called "character portraits", but this can easily be used to show images of any sort.
