Adds a dialog tag which allows you to present the player with binary dialog choices.

Usage:

{choice
  - option one
    result of picking option
  - option two
    result of picking option
}

Recommended uses:

DLG_simple_response
"""
Greeting text
{choice
  - Response one
    answer to response one
  - Response two
    answer to response two
}
"""

DLG_complex_response
"""
Greeting text
{choice
  - Response one
    {a = 1}
  - Response two
    {a = 2}
}
constant part of answer{
  - a == 1 ?
    custom part based on response one
  - a == 2 ?
    custom part based on response two
}
"""

Note: it's recommended you combine this hack
with the dialog jump hack for complex cases.

Limitations:

Each option must fit on a single line, or the interaction will break.
Checking the value of a variable set in an option
*immediately after the choice* will not work,
as it will evaluate before the player has selected
an option if there is no text inbetween the two.
e.g.

"""
{a = 1}
{choice
  - Response one
    {a = 2}
  - Response two
    {a = 3}
}
{
  - a == 1 ?
    this will print
  - a == 2 ?
    these will not
  - a == 3 ?
    these will not
}
