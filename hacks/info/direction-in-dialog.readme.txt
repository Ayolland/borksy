Provides a variable "playerDirection" that can be accessed in dialog

The value will be one of:
  - "up"
  - "down"
  - "left"
  - "right"
Depending on the last input from the player.

Note that the variable will describe the direction the player moved,
so if they're interacting with a sprite, the opposite will be the direction from which they came

i.e. if the player moves into a sprite from the left, the variable will be "right"
