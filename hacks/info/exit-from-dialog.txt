Lets you exit to another room from dialog (including inside conditionals). Use
it to make an invisible sprite that acts as a conditional exit, use it to warp
somewhere after a conversation, use it to put a guard at your gate who only
lets you in once you're disguised, use it to require payment before the
ferryman will take you across the river.

Using the (exit) function in any part of a series of dialog will make the
game exit to the new room after the dialog is finished. Using (exitNow) will
immediately warp to the new room, but the current dialog will continue.

WARNING: In exit coordinates, the TOP LEFT tile is (0,0). In sprite coordinates,
         the BOTTOM LEFT tile is (0,0). If you'd like to use sprite coordinates,
         add the word "sprite" as the fourth parameter to the exit function.

Usage: (exit "<room name>,<x>,<y>")
       (exit "<room name>,<x>,<y>,sprite")
       (exitNow "<room name>,<x>,<y>")
       (exitNow "<room name>,<x>,<y>,sprite")

Example: (exit "FinalRoom,8,4")
         (exitNow "FinalRoom,8,11,sprite")

NOTE: This uses parentheses "()" instead of curly braces "{}" around function
      calls because the Bitsy editor's fancy dialog window strips unrecognized
      curly-brace functions from dialog text. To keep from losing data, write
      these function calls with parentheses like the examples above.
