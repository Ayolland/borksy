Use the following dialog tags to edit a room's tiles, sprites, or items

-- DRAW DIALOG TAG REFERENCE -----------------------------------

{draw "type, source, x, y, room"}
{drawNow "type, source, x, y, room"}
{drawBox "type, source, x1, y1, x2, y2 room"}
{drawBoxNow "type, source, x1, y1, x2, y2 room"}
{drawAll "type, source, room"}
{drawAllNow "type, source, room"}

Information:
-----------------------------------
- "draw" creates a tile, item, or sprite at a location in a room. Can be a fixed position, or relative to the player.
- "drawBox" is as above, but draws tiles, items, or sprites in a box/line, defined by a top left and bottom right corner.
- "drawAll" is as above, but affects an entire room.
- Adding "Now" causes it to draw immediately, rather than waiting until the dialog ends.

Parameters:
-----------------------------------
- type:		Type of room contents to draw (TIL, ITM, or SPR)
			Tile (TIL): Each location can have only one Tile. Drawing over an existing tile replaces it.
			Item (ITM): Multiple items can exist in one spot, but only the most recent item is picked up.
			Sprite (SPR): Only one copy of each Sprite can exist at a time; redrawing a sprite moves it.
- source:	The ID (number/letter) of the tile, item, or sprite to draw.
- x, y:		The x and y coordinates you want to draw at, from 0-15.
- x1, y1:	(For drawBox only) The x and y coordinates of the top left tile you want to draw on, from 0-15.
- x2, y2:	(For drawBox only) The x and y coordinates of the bottom right tile you want to draw on, from 0-15.
			Put + or - before any coordinate to draw relative to the player's current position. (ex. +10, -2, etc.).
			Leave any coordinate blank (or use +0) to use the player's current X (or Y) position. (If blank, still add commas)
- room:		The ID (number/letter) of the room you're drawing in. (Refer to Game Data tab for Room IDs)
			Leave blank to default to modifying the room the player is currently in.

-- ERASE DIALOG TAG REFERENCE ----------------------------------

{erase "type, target, x, y, room"}
{eraseNow "type, target, x, y, room"}
{eraseBox "type, target, x1, y1, x2, y2 room"}
{eraseBoxNow "type, target, x1, y1, x2, y2 room"}
{eraseAll "type, target, room"}
{eraseAllNow "type, target, room"}

Information:
-----------------------------------
- "erase" Removes tiles, items, or sprites at a location in a room. Can be a fixed position, or relative to the player.
- "eraseBox" is as above, but erases tiles, items, or sprites in a box/line, defined by a top left and bottom right corner.
- "eraseAll" is as above, but affects an entire room.
- Adding "Now" causes it to erase immediately, rather than waiting until the dialog ends.

-----------------------------------
- type:		Type of room contents to erase (ANY, TIL, ITM, or SPR)
			Anything (ANY): Erasing anything will target all valid Tiles, Items, and Sprites.
			Tile (TIL): Erasing a Tile causes that location to be empty and walkable.
			Item (ITM): Erasing an Item affects all valid target items, even if there are more than one.
			Sprite (SPR): Erasing a Sprite removes it from a room, but it will remember dialog progress, etc.
			Leaving this blank will default to targeting ANY. (If blank, still include commas)
- target:	The ID (number/letter) of the tile, item, or sprite to erase. Other objects will not be erased.
			Leave this blank, or set this to "ANY", to target all tiles, items, and/or sprites. (If blank, still include commas)
- x, y:		The x and y coordinates you want to erase at, from 0-15.
- x1, y1:	(For eraseBox only) The x and y coordinates of the top left tile you want to erase at, from 0-15.
- x2, y2:	(For eraseBox only) The x and y coordinates of the bottom right tile you want to erase at, from 0-15.
			Leave X (or Y) blank to use the player's current X (or Y) position. (If blank, still include commas)
			Put + or - before the number to erase relative to the player's current position. (ex. +10, -2, etc.).
- room:		The ID (number/letter) of the room you're erasing in. (Refer to Game Data tab for Room IDs)
			Leave blank to default to modifying the room the player is currently in.
