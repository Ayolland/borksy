// influences the resolution of the drawn image
// `bitsy.scale` (4 by default) is the max and will match bitsy's internal scale (i.e. 512x512)
// 1 will match bitsy's in-game virtual scale (i.e. 128x128)
// it's best to decide this up-front and make portrait images that match this resolution

scale: bitsy.scale,
  
// a list of portrait files
// the format is: 'id for portrait tag': 'file path'
// these may be:
// - local files (in which case you need to include them with your html when publishing)
// - online urls (which are not guaranteed to work as they are network-dependent)
// - base64-encoded images (the most reliable but unwieldy)
