* In some cases (usually smaller games), adding the 'Transparent Sprites' hack can actually improve the performance of your Bitsy game.

* Looking for the 'Paragraph Break' hack? Use 'Long Dialog' instead. It has all the same functionality and more!

* You can access the Bitsy game variables from JavaScript using `window.scriptInterpreter.GetVariable(variableName)` and `window.scriptInterpreter.SetVariable(variableName)`

* Using CSS to add a background image to your game can add a lot of polish for mimimal effort, especially on mobile.

* Borksy changes the canvas rendering of Bitsy game to display crisp pixel-edges. This can be commented out in the CSS if your prefer the default anti-aliasing.

* Remember, you can add hacks that aren't included in Borksy using the 'Additional JS' field.
