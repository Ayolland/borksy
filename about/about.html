<p>Feb 28, 2021 - What&#8217;s new in 4.4.1:</p>

<ul>
<li>I literally just added the backdrops hack b/c it&#8217;s v cool and ppl wanted it.</li>
<li>For technical reasons, this was harder than it sounds.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE on upcoming changes to Bitsy:</strong> Bitsy 8.0 is currently in development. It&#8217;s unclear at this moment what that means for Borksy, although I will try to find a solution that assists as many Borksy users as possible. My personal advice is to finish any incomplete projects you are currently working on that use Bitsy 7.</p>

<p>The Bitsy 6.5 templates and older are kept in Borksy as a legacy feature, however currently most hacks have been updated to support Bitsy 7.0 and may not be compatible with older versions. If you are building a project using an older version of Bitsy, Borksy may not be a good solution for you. Seek help in the Bitsy discord if you are working on a Bitsy project that requires Bitsy 6.5 or older.</p>
