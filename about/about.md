Borksy v 2.4

Borksy is a hacking tool to be used in conjunction with [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)! Use it to customize your games and add hacks without needing a web server or any manual cut-and-paste work.

Borksy currently uses Bitsy 4.8 to create files.

If you're not familiar with how Bitsy can be extended, check out [Sean's great collection of Bitsy hacks](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/).

**NOTE TO BORKSY USERS:** Future Bitsy versions will change how bitsy renders text and use a new font size. Once that happens, the current custom font tool will be deprecated until a new custom font tool can be built. The current fonts will not be compatible, so if you have a project that plans to use those fonts, use them before they disappear.

What's new in 2.4:
* ðŸŽ¶Bitsymuse Hack addedðŸŽ¶!
* Multi-Sprite Avatar added!
