Borksy v 4.3

Borksy is a hacking tool to be used in conjunction with [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)! Use it to customize your games and add hacks without needing a web server or any manual cut-and-paste work.

If you're not sure how to use this tool, check out the 'How To Use Borksy' section. If you're having issues, check the 'Troubleshooting/FAQs' section. If you're not familiar with how Bitsy can be extended, explore [Sean's great collection of Bitsy hacks](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/).

April 22, 2020 - What's new in 4.3:
* Bitsy 7.0 template
* Bitsy 6.5 template
* Added 'Gravity', 'Textbox Styler', and 'Edit Room From Dialog' hacks
* Cleaned up hack options and readme files to be more accurate and helpful.
* Removed '3d', 'Extended Logic Operators', and 'Character Portraits Animated' hacks
* (Above hacks were either buggy, or incompatible with Borksy)

**NOTE:** The Bitsy 6.5 template has been added as a legacy feature, however most hacks have been updated to support Bitsy 7.0 and may not be compatible with older versions. If you are building a project using an older version of Bitsy, Borksy may not be a good solution for you. Seek help in the Bitsy discord if you are working on a Bitsy project that requires Bitsy 6.5 or older. **The exit-from-dialog and end-from-dialog hack will likely be deprecated in the future**, as Bitsy 7.0 now supports locked/conditional exits natively.

Borksy Features:
* Multiple Bitsy version templates
* Preloaded Hacks Menu
* Hacks are retrieved from Github, with local backups
* Editable hack options
* Customize HTML/CSS
* Customize page title / filename
* Field for extra JS / hacks
* Saves work to LocalStorage for persistence
* Updated default Bitsy font with more consistent unicode support
* Party Mode!
