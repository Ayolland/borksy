Borksy v 3.1

Borksy is a hacking tool to be used in conjunction with [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)! Use it to customize your games and add hacks without needing a web server or any manual cut-and-paste work.

Borksy currently uses Bitsy 5.1 to create files.

If you're not sure how to use this tool, check out the 'How To Use Borksy' section. If you're not familiar with how Bitsy can be extended, explore [Sean's great collection of Bitsy hacks](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/).

**NOTE TO BORKSY USERS:** Custom fonts have been deprecated from Borksy, as the font conversion tool Borksy used is no longer compatible with Bitsy 5.1. Bitsy now has its own built-in font-importer, and hopefully a new font conversion tool will be coming down the road shortly.

Aug 14, 2018 - What's new in 3.2:
* Moved to use Bitsy 5.1
* Deprecated the Font Tool

Other Borksy Features:
* Preloaded Hacks Menu
* Hacks are retrieved from Github, with local backups
* Editable hack Options
* HotKeys
* Customize HTML/CSS
* Customize Page Title / Filename
* Font Importer and Presets *(deprecated)*
* Field for extra JS / Hacks
* Saves work to LocalStorage for persistence
