Borksy v 4.4.1

Borksy is a hacking tool to be used in conjunction with [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)! Use it to customize your games and add hacks without needing a web server or any manual cut-and-paste work.

Feb 28, 2021 - What's new in 4.4.1:
* I literally just added the backdrops hack b/c it's v cool and ppl wanted it.
* For technical reasons, this was harder than it sounds.

**NOTE on upcoming changes to Bitsy:** Bitsy 8.0 is currently in development. It's unclear at this moment what that means for Borksy, although I will try to find a solution that assists as many Borksy users as possible. My personal advice is to finish any incomplete projects you are currently working on that use Bitsy 7.

The Bitsy 6.5 templates and older are kept in Borksy as a legacy feature, however currently most hacks have been updated to support Bitsy 7.0 and may not be compatible with older versions. If you are building a project using an older version of Bitsy, Borksy may not be a good solution for you. Seek help in the Bitsy discord if you are working on a Bitsy project that requires Bitsy 6.5 or older.

Borksy Features:
* Multiple Bitsy version templates
* Preloaded Hacks Menu
* Hacks are retrieved from Github, with local backups
* Editable hack options
* Customize HTML/CSS
* Customize page title / filename
* Field for extra JS / hacks
* Saves work to LocalStorage for persistence
* Updated default Bitsy font with more consistent unicode support
* Party Mode!
