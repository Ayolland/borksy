Borksy v 3.6

Borksy is a hacking tool to be used in conjunction with [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)! Use it to customize your games and add hacks without needing a web server or any manual cut-and-paste work.

Borksy currently uses Bitsy 5.4 to create files.

If you're not sure how to use this tool, check out the 'How To Use Borksy' section, *especially if you are using a custom font.* If you're not familiar with how Bitsy can be extended, explore [Sean's great collection of Bitsy hacks](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/).
