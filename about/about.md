Borksy v 3.5

Borksy is a hacking tool to be used in conjunction with [Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy)! Use it to customize your games and add hacks without needing a web server or any manual cut-and-paste work.

Borksy currently uses Bitsy 5.3 to create files.

If you're not sure how to use this tool, check out the 'How To Use Borksy' section. If you're not familiar with how Bitsy can be extended, explore [Sean's great collection of Bitsy hacks](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/).

**NOTE TO BORKSY USERS:** Custom fonts have been deprecated from Borksy. Now there's [Fontsy](https://seansleblanc.itch.io/fontsy) for customizing your own fonts!
