<p>In order to use Borksy, you need to already have a Bitsy game you wish to add functionality to.</p>

<p>Borksy accepts the game data from Bitsy and saves out a modified HTML file that includes your bitsy game as well as any hacks or modifications you chose to include. You&#8217;ll need to copy the game data from the Bitsy editor and paste it into Borksy. The file Borksy saves is the file you will release as your game.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using a custom font, make sure that the font data is included when you paste your game data into Borksy. In Bitsy, the font data is hidden by default, even if you&#8217;re using a custom font. In order for it be able to be copied, you&#8217;ll need to click the &#8216;font data&#8217; button on the button of the &#8216;game data&#8217; window in Bitsy before copy your game data.</p>

<p>Loading a Borksy file with the Bitsy editor will load the Bitsy game data, but will strip away any hacks/modifications added with Borksy. (Bitsy doesn&#8217;t know anything about Borksy, and can&#8217;t read/store the changes Borksy makes.)</p>

<p>While Borksy uses your browser data to save your work, it is a good idea to save any modifications (hackOptions, additional JS, HTML modifications) you make on your computer somewhere separately, as there is no way for Borksy to load these from a saved Borksy game.</p>
