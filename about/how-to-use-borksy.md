In order to use Borksy, you need to already have a Bitsy game you wish to add functionality to.

Borksy accepts the game data from Bitsy and saves out a modified HTML file that includes your bitsy game as well as any hacks or modifications you chose to include. You'll need to copy the game data from the Bitsy editor and paste it into Borksy. The file Borksy saves is the file you will release as your game.

Hacks are not guaranteed to work with each other. While many hacks do, make sure you test the particular load-out of hacks you plan to use before developing for them.

If you're using a custom font, make sure that the font data is included when you paste your game data into Borksy. In Bitsy, the font data is hidden by default, even if you're using a custom font. In order for it be able to be copied, you'll need to click the 'font data' button on the button of the 'game data' window in Bitsy before copy your game data.

Loading a Borksy file with the Bitsy editor will load the Bitsy game data, but will strip away any hacks/modifications added with Borksy. (Bitsy doesn't know anything about Borksy, and can't read/store the changes Borksy makes.)

While Borksy uses your browser data to save your work, it is a good idea to save any modifications (hackOptions, additional JS, HTML modifications) you make on your computer somewhere separately, as there is no way for Borksy to load these from a saved Borksy game.
