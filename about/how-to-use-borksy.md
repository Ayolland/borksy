In order to use Borksy, you need to already have a Bitsy game you wish to add functionality to.

Borksy accepts the game data from Bitsy and saves out a modified HTML file that includes your bitsy game as well as any hacks or modifications you chose to include. You'll need to copy the game data from the Bitsy editor and paste it into Borksy. The file Borksy saves is the file you will release as your game. 

Loading a Borksy file with the Bitsy editor will load the Bitsy game data, but will strip away any hacks/modifications added with Borksy. (Bitsy doesn't know anything about Borksy, and can't read/store the changes Borksy makes.)

While Borksy uses your browser data to save your work, it is a good idea to save any modifications (hackOptions, additional JS, HTML modifications) you make on your computer somewhere separately, as there is no way for Borksy to load these from a saved Borksy game.
